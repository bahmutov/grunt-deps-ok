## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-deps-ok --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-deps-ok');
grunt.registerTask('default', ['deps-ok', rest of the tasks]);
```

That's it! Every time grunt runs, it will **quickly** check if all (normal, dev, peer) top
level dependencies are present in the *node_modules* folder. It will also verify
that the installed module versions are greater or equal to the ones declared inside *package.json* file.

You can configure further by providing options

```js
// Gruntfile.js
'deps-ok': {
  options: {
    verbose: true,
    force: true // print error message, but pass the task
    skipBower: false, // do not check bower.json even if exists
    folder: 'path/to/folder/with/package.json' // options, by default current folder
  }
}
```

There are other modules that check npm dependencies, for example [grunt-check-modules](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-check-modules).
It seems to rely on `npm ls` command that takes a long time to go through the dependency tree.
In my projects, *deps_ok* step takes less than 100ms, compared to 5-10 seconds for *grunt-check-modules*.
